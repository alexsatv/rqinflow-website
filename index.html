        <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="300" data-aos-duration="900">like i mentioned above, i started editing with after effects in around april 2020, but i've been editing for way longer than that. i've been interested in editing and making videos for as long as i can remember. when was younger i would make 3d animations in blender, most of them just being 3d text, low-poly houses and very short minecraft animations. recently, i've been trying to get back into blender and so far it's been really enjoyable. in after effects i have a decent amount of knowledge after making edits, and i can make small projects using after effects, and i always have a lot of fun when i have the time to edit with after effects. you can check out my instagram edits here:</p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300" data-aos-duration="600">over the past year i've spent a lot of time coding. i started off trying to make a discord bot using node.js, but after some trial and error, and a lot of frustration, i decided that i would give python a try instead. i ended up having more luck using discord.py and since then i've made great progress. i can now retrive data from instagram, gifs from giphy, photos from both google and imgur and generate color schemes, from my bot alone. i recently also hooked by bot up to a SQL database and made an economy system. i've mainly been focusing on discord.py, but i also made some stuff on the side. i made a snake game using pygame, i made a color generator using tkinter, i made a simple calculator, i tried building some websites with flask and i also made a application that can extract data from instagram (follower count etc.). going forward i am now planning on trying to learn some game development as well, and try to learn more node.js and other languages.</p>
